# drupal7_listrak_example
Example Drupal 7 module with custom Listrak Email Integration

This is a work example of a custom Drupal 7 module. This module integrates with the third party email solutions provider Listrak. It has dependencies on the following two modules in order to work properly:

https://www.drupal.org/project/mollom

https://github.com/ShalomPisteuo/drupal-listrak-integration

The module creates four custom blocks which include custom drupal webforms. The contents of these webforms are then submitted to Listrak to be included in a specified list.

The module includes a custom administration/configuration page that allows the user to specify a username and password with API access to Listrak.

This code base will not work for your specific needs with Listrak. It is only provided as a guide and example that you can apply to your own project.
